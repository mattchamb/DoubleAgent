DoubleAgent
===========

This project attempts to use nodejs as a http server for [OWIN](http://owin.org/spec/owin-1.0.0.html) middleware and web frameworks. 
This is achieved by using protocol buffers to send requests and responses between processes so it can be handled by an OWIN compliant framework.
